# How to Build an AI Browser Assistant with Python - Step by Step Tutorial

## Introduction

Hey everyone! Today, I'm going to show you how to build your own AI-powered browser assistant that can automate tasks like web scraping, form filling, and data extraction. This project uses Python and the Gemini AI model to create a smart browser automation tool.

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment

First, let's set up our development environment:

1. Create a new project folder:

```bash
mkdir browser-use-project
cd browser-use-project
```

2. Create a Python virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

- On Windows:

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

- On Mac/Linux:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Step 2: Installing Required Packages

Now, let's install the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install browser-use
```

## Step 3: Setting Up API Keys

1. Create a `.env` file in your project folder
2. Add your Gemini API key:

```
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

```bash
brew install --cask chromium
```

## Step 4: Writing Your First Script

Let's create a simple script to test our setup. Create a file called `test.py`:

```python
from browser_use import BrowserUse
from dotenv import load_dotenv
import os

# Load environment variables
load_dotenv()

# Initialize the browser assistant
browser = BrowserUse()

# Define your task
task = "Go to Amazon and search for 'gaming laptops'. Get the first 3 product names and prices."

# Run the task
result = browser.run(task)

# Print the results
print(result)
```

## Step 5: Running Your Script

Execute your script:

```bash
playwright install
```

```bash
python examples/simple.py
```

## Step 6: Understanding the Results

The script will:

1. Open a browser window
2. Navigate to Amazon
3. Search for gaming laptops
4. Extract the first 3 product names and prices
5. Display the results in your terminal

## Common Issues and Solutions

1. If you get an API key error:

   - Double-check your `.env` file
   - Make sure the API key is correct
   - Ensure you've activated your virtual environment

2. If you get rate limit errors:
   - Wait a few minutes before trying again
   - Consider upgrading your API plan if needed

## Advanced Usage

You can modify the task to do different things:

- Extract data from any website
- Fill out forms automatically
- Compare prices across different sites
- Monitor website changes

## Conclusion

That's it! You've now created your own AI-powered browser assistant. This tool can be used for various automation tasks, making your web browsing and data collection much more efficient.
